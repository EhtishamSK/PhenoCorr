# PhenoCorr - Phenotypic Correlation and Heat Network Maps

- **Objective**: Perform correlation analysis among phenotypic traits.  
- **Data**: Uses adjusted means dataset (`data.csv`).  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Computes Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficients.  
  - Tests significance of trait associations.  
  - Creates formatted correlation tables with significance stars (*, **, ***).  
- **Visualization**:  
  - Network plots (`qgraph`) to display correlations.  
  - Option to highlight only significant correlations.  
  - Groups traits into categories (Plant Architecture, Fruit Destemming, Fruit Morphology, Yield).  
- **Output**:  
  - Correlation tables saved as CSV.  
  - High-resolution PNG network plots of correlation structure.
